## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Instant OCR**: Utilizes Tesseract.js to accurately extract text from images directly on the client-side.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Images are processed in your browser and are never uploaded to a server, ensuring your data remains private.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports a wide range of languages, with optimized performance for English and Bengali.
- **Automatic Translation**: Instantly translates extracted Bengali text to English via a secure backend service.
- **Modern UI/UX**:
    - Sleek, responsive design that works on all devices.
    - **Dark Mode** to reduce eye strain, with your preference saved locally.
    - Intuitive **drag-and-drop** and **paste-from-clipboard** functionality.
- **Rich Feedback**:
    - Live image preview before processing.
    - Real-time progress bar and status updates.
    - Detailed **word and character counts** of the extracted text.

## üí° How It Works

This application uses a hybrid architecture to maximize both privacy and functionality:

1.  **Client-Side OCR**: When you upload an image, all Optical Character Recognition is performed directly in your web browser using **Tesseract.js**. Your image file never leaves your computer, guaranteeing the privacy of your data.

2.  **Server-Side Translation**: For translation, the extracted text is sent to a lightweight **Node.js backend server**. This server acts as a secure proxy, adding the secret API key before forwarding the request to the Google Translate API. This prevents exposing sensitive keys on the frontend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* A code editor like **Visual Studio Code** with the **Live Server** extension.

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hasanulhossaint/TomtoTEXT.git
    cd TomtoTEXT
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (Translation Server):**
    * Navigate to the directory containing your `server.js` file.
    * Install the required NPM packages:
        ```bash
        npm install express cors @google-cloud/translate
        ```
    * **Crucial:** You must set up your Google Cloud API credentials. For local development, the recommended approach is to use [Google Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

3.  **Run the Application:**
    * **Start the Backend Server:** Open a terminal in the server directory and run:
        ```bash
        node server.js
        ```
        Your translation server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

    * **Start the Frontend:** In VS Code, right-click the `index.html` file and select **"Open with Live Server"**. This will open the web app in your browser.
